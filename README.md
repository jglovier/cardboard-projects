# Cardboard Projects 📦

Many of us in our modern world get packages frequently (thanks online shopping!). Those packages often are cardboard boxes, which can be thrown away or recycled. 

But there is a third option: **Re-use**!!

In our house, we've started re-using cardboard boxes as much as possible (and what we cannot reuse, we recycle). There are so many fun things you can do with cardboard (currently we are working on a cardboard monster truck inspired by similar projects on YouTube).

This repo is about collecting and documenting the projects we have made and would like to make with cardboard, both for our own archives and for inspiring others to re-use their cardboard in fun and creative ways too.
